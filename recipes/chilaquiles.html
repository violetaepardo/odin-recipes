        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
            <li>1 white onion, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 poblano pepper, peeled and seeded</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 leaves fresh mint</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded cooked chicken</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>12 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, cut into 3 strips</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded pepperjack cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Blend tomatillos, onion, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, cilantro, garlic, mint, and salt in a blender until smooth. Transfer mixture to a saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Add chicken to tomatillo sauce and continue to simmer until chicken is heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tortilla strips in batches until crisp and lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Layer about half the fried tortillas in a 2-quart baking dish; spread half the tomatillo sauce over tortillas. Mix pepperjack cheese and Monterey Jack cheese in a bowl; sprinkle half over tomatillo sauce. Repeat layers.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is golden and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow to cool 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
